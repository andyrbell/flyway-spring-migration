= Flyway SpringJdbcMigration Problem

This project is an attempt to replicate http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42941777/flyway-migrate-load-constraint-violation-with-spring[this issue] described on Stack Overflow.

The problem occurs with Flyway 4.1.2.

The spring-jdbc library needed to be added to the buildscript dependencies to get it working with 4.1.2.

It does work for Flyway 4.0.3 without this explicit dependency. Not sure why.

It is worth noting that the flyway-gradle-plugin was converted to java from groovy between these versions.

== Running

[source]
----
docker-compose up -d
./gradlew build flywayMigrate --stacktrace
----

== Error

To replicate the error, comment out the following line in build.gradle and re-run.

[source]
----
classpath("org.springframework:spring-jdbc:${springVersion}")
----

On the first run, it will give the following error

[source]
----
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/springframework/jdbc/core/JdbcTemplate
----

On all subsequent runs it will give the `loader constraint violation` described in the issue.
